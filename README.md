As a winner of CIBC machine intelligence, we are willing to share our solutions and code.

Most of feature engineering is completed in mysql service. The code was not uploaded in GitHub. Due to 24 hours hackathon,the jupyter noteboo is not clean and neat and many of them did't include comments. But slides include the methodology and analytics of the work.
